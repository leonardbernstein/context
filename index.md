### Significance vs. Substance: Decoding the Phone Ban Hype

Amid global smartphone [bans](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2025/09/04/banning-smartphones-in-classrooms-helps-students) sweeping classrooms—from South Korea's August decree to 35 U.S. states' policies—AIs distill a stark statistical truth: Science often chases [p-values](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/09/03/schools-should-banish-smartphones-from-the-classroom) (proof of "real" effects) while sidelining R-squared (actual explanatory power), inflating trivial findings into triumphs.

The linchpin: Alp Sungu's 2025 RCT on 17,000 Indian students. Banning phones boosted grades by 0.086 standard deviations (p=0.009, t=2.39)—statistically significant, especially for low-performers, freshmen, and non-STEM kids. Yet implied R-squared hovers at ~0.007 (0.7% variance explained), typical in education where human chaos (motivation, home life, teaching) drowns single factors.

AIs rank fields by bias:
1. **Psychology/Medicine/Social Sciences**: P-value obsession fuels replication crises; low R^2 (0.1-0.3 norm) ignored for "significant" crumbs.
2. **Economics/Politics**: Causal hunts prioritize p, footnotes R^2—yielding precise but puny effects.
3. **Genetics/Epidemiology**: Ultra-strict p (e.g., 5e-8), but admit tiny R^2 needs aggregation.
4. **ML/Engineering**: R^2 reigns for prediction; p-values? Irrelevant relics.
5. **Physics**: Theory trumps both; demands near-perfect fit.

Commentary: Soft sciences' p-addiction spawns "significance theater"—real but irrelevant results, like bans' modest nudge amid education's reverse gear. Hard fields build rockets; these churn press releases. Norms excuse low R^2 as "complexity," but warn lay readers: Don't dive down rabbit holes without context. A "significant" 1% variance? Often noise, not needle-mover.

For children, teachers, parents: P-values are for labs; R^2/effect size for life. Bans cut chatter, curb cheating, spark student buy-in (20% more support post-trial)—low-cost calm, meaningful for strugglers. But no miracle: Ask, "Big enough to matter?" Not "Just real?" Substance over stats—lest policy chase ghosts.
